## FAQ

#### How do I personalize this website?

To edit this website, simply fork the repository and edit the "index.html" and the "style.css" in the "media" folder. 
Reading through the code should be enough to understand what you are able to edit.

#### How do I make the Discord Embed work?

-  Go to Discord Server Settings
- "Widget"
- Enable Server Widget
- Select an Invite Channel (e.g. the main chat)
- Manually copy ONLY THE LINK ("https://discord.com/widget?id=[SERVER-ID]&theme=dark")
- Replace the imgur link in the Discord Section with the Discord Widget link

#### Where can I host this website?

I recommend hosting the website on your own Linux VServer with Caddyserver, but if you need to have a free hosting service, I recommend Neocities or GitHub Pages.

#### Why would I need such a website?

This website can help to provide additional information about your Minecraft Server and get people to join it.

#### Can I use this freely without copyright?

You can use and edit the website as much as you want, as long as the "Made by FQQD 2023" stays on the bottom of the site unchanged.
