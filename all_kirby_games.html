            <p>
              Kirby was invented in 1992 by Masahiro Sakurai. His games have
              always been cheerful and fun experiences, loved by people of all
              ages. In this section I will showcase all the different Kirby
              games that have been released throughout the years.

                <p>
                  Kirby's Dream Land (JP) is the first title in the Kirby series
                  and the debut of the pink protagonist Kirby. The game was
                  released in 1992 for the Game Boy and was created by series
                  mastermind Masahiro Sakurai, who went on to develop most of
                  the games in the series and other titles such as the Super
                  Smash Bros. series. Kirby possesses the ability to suck in
                  enemies and shoot them out as stars, however, he lacks his
                  Copy Ability from the later titles. The game was intended for
                  people new to gaming, and thus playing its four levels, is
                  rather simple. This game in its entirety, except for Castle
                  Lololo, is included in Kirby Super Star (Kirby's Fun Pak in
                  PAL countries) as Spring Breeze. Kirby's Dream Land was
                  released on the 3DS's Virtual Console in 2011.

                  Kirby's Block Ball is a Game Boy video game released in 1995
                  by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory. Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei
                  Yokoi both served as the game's producers. The game is based
                  on the arcade hit Breakout, but instead of using a standard
                  ball, you use Kirby to break the blocks. The game was also
                  released on Virtual Console for the 3DS in 2012, and it also
                  appears in a non-playable form in Kirby's Dream Collection.

                  game for the NES home console. The game is the first and only
                  Kirby video game to be released on the NES. The game was later
                  re-released on the GBA, Wii's Virtual Console for 500 points.
                  It was also released on the 3DS and Wii U's Virtual Console.
                  The objective of the game is to reach the end of the level, by
                  inhaling enemies and solving the relatively easy puzzles. This
                  game also marks the first appearance of Kirby's wonderful

                  Kirby Super Star (JP) (Kirby's Fun Pak in PAL regions) is a
                  title on the SNES that was released in 1996. It is considered
                  by many Kirby fans to be the best game in the series. Kirby
                  Super Star is a compilation of many games into one. The most
                  popular of these are the Great Cave Offensive, Revenge of
                  Meta-Knight, and Milky Way Wishes. Notably, this is the first
                  Kirby title in which almost every one of Kirby's copy
                  abilities has multiple uses. Kirby Super Star also introduced
                  some of the arguably most popular abilities in the series,
                  including Fighter.

                  Kirby's animal friends could help him out during the game, and
                  more were added since then. Much like the ability mixing
                  system in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, Kirby could get one of
                  his abilities and then get assistance from a friend to create
                  a whole new ability.

                  Kirby Canvas Curse (JP), also called Kirby: Canvas Curse and
                  known in Europe as Kirby: Power Paintbrush, is a platformer
                  adventure game for the Nintendo DS that was initially released
                  in 2005 and the first game in the series to be released for
                  the console. The game features unique touch screen control and
                  fun mini-games. In the game, you must draw rainbow tracks for
                  Kirby to ride on. The farther the track goes, the faster Kirby
                  will go. If you tap Kirby, he will do a spin attack killing
                  most enemies that he runs into. If you tap an enemy, the enemy
                  will pause, allowing Kirby just to run into him to kill him.
                  This is another Kirby game in which he is a ball, like in the
                  2015 Wii U sequel Kirby and the Rainbow Curse.

                  Kirby Squeak Squad, also called Kirby: Squeak Squad and known

                  series, announced at E3 2006 and released later that year and
                  is the second Kirby game to be released for the Nintendo DS.
                  This is also the second Kirby side-scroller that wasn't
                  developed by HAL, but instead was developed by Flagship, who
                  previously made some Zelda handheld games. Unlike the previous
                  Kirby game, Kirby Canvas Curse, which used the touch screen
                  throughout the whole game, this game is a standard Kirby
                  experience.

                  of one of the original sub-games, Spring Breeze. It also

                  Epic Yarn was announced to be coming to the 3DS. However, the
                  official game page later stated that the game was going to be
                  exclusive to the New 3DS systems, causing a bit of confusion,

                  Kirby's Epic Yarn (JP) is a 2010 platformer video game
                  released on the Wii, that was first announced at E3 2010. Epic
                  Yarn is the first home console Kirby game since Kirby Air Ride
                  on the GameCube, released in 2003. The game is developed by
                  Good-Feel, that, amongst others, previously developed Wario
                  Land: Shake It! The game was ported to Nintendo 3DS in March
                  2019 as Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn. It added new power-ups and
                  minigames and is the seventh and final Kirby game for the
                  system. At a Nintendo Direct in September 2018, Kirby's Extra
                  Epic Yarn was announced to be coming to the 3DS. However, the
                  official game page later stated that the game was going to be
                  exclusive to the New 3DS systems, causing a bit of confusion,
                  but two weeks later, it was announced that the game would be
                  played on all the 3DS models.

                  North America on September 16, 2012, but it was never released

                  Nintendo Magazine confirmed a Winter 2012 release was planned.
                  This was the final first-party title to be released for the
                  Wii by Nintendo in those regions.
