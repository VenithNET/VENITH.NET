              This is a page where I talk about Anime series or movies that I

              </audio>
              <p>
                One of my comfort anime, Non Non Biyori is a slice of life that
                lets you follow the life of school girls in rural Japan, with
                beautiful scenery, music, and stories. If you have not watched
                it yet, I heavily recommend it, as well as the movies.

                An anime full of sillyness and I love it for it, it's another
                slice of life but it's very funny! I can relate to Osaka that
                falls asleep often during class, like I did. Sakaki is also
                relatable because she is very introverted. Overall, amazing
                anime with peak memes, go watch it now.

                If you watched Bocchi the Rock, this is what probably inspired
                it! A slice of life music anime with awesome songs (especially
                the opening and ending songs), sweet characters (Yui and
                Azusa!), and emotional moments (the ending). It's also my
                hyperfixation as of writing this, so yeah love it. Absolute
                peak.

                Even more silly than Azumanga Daioh, Nichijou is slice of life
                but with the comedy aspect on steroids, with no regards for the
                laws of physics sometimes. It's a masterpiece visually, with the
                amazing art style that it has, and story-wise, it's also very
                good. I also enjoyed the Manga a lot, which has more content
                than the Anime. Peak anime, recommend.

                Naruto & Naruto Shippuden are my childhood. Seriously it is the
                best anime I've ever seen. The story is incredible and the
                characters are so inspiring. My favorite characters are
                Shikamaru because of his intelligence and maturity, Kakashi for
                being a mentor figure, and Jiraiya for his wisdom (paired with
                sillyness). Every opening and ending songs are bangers. Heavily
                recommend this anime.

                Very cute anime with funny characters, especially Konata who
                likes manga and anime (animeception?), and the "Lucky Channel"
                bit at the end of every episode. This anime has a lot of
                talking, so much that I couldn't keep track with the subtitles
                at some point, which made switch to the dubbed version. But it's
                very fun overall, I also like the extras that were included in
                the Blu-Ray disc.

                A pretty new anime that has taken off in popularity especially
                in Japan, Bocchi the Rock follows the life of Hitori Gotoh, who
                dreams of becoming a famous guitarist but can't even make a
                single friend. She luckily gets recruited into a band and that's
                where her life changes. This anime has absolute banger songs and
                the main character is very relatable to me. The manga is also
                very good. Heavily recommend it.

                This is an amazing anime that is a bit hard to understand, but
                it shows how one can lose themselves and forget who they are if
                they become obsessed with the online world. In the anime, the
                "wired" is like another space, different from reality. I
                recommend checking it out, but be wary that it has some mature
                themes like self harm and worse, so don't watch if you are
                sensitive.

                An underrated anime that is made by the same person behind
                Serial Experiments Lain. You follow the life of a girl reborn as
                a "haibane" which resembles angels, with no explanation of why.
                It explores spiritual themes and is very mysterious. It's a cool
                anime, with some sad moments. Overall very good anime, but a bit
                short.

                An anime where the main protagonist wakes up and learns that he
                is dead. He is amnesic and doesn't remember how he landed here,
                but he quickly finds other people that explain to him what the
                world he landed in is about. The others have united to fight
                "God", or rather his angel. They all have died horribly and
                blame God for their horrible existence. As the anime goes on,
                the main protagonist plays a key role in helping the others find
                peace, which makes them exit the world to be reincarnated. But I
                won't spoil any further. I really enjoyed this anime for the
                deep message that it gave, the humor, and the visuals which are
                really good (I enjoy that art style).

                This one is about the struggle of Tatsuhiro Satou, a japanese
                hikikomori, which is basically someone secluded from society and
                that almost never leaves their home, because of an inability to
                adapt to society. This anime tackles serious issues and does so
                in a realistic manner. I can say that I could relate to the main
                character more than once. I do recommend you to watch this, but
                be warned that it does contain serious themes (self-harm) and
                some scenes have nudity in them.
