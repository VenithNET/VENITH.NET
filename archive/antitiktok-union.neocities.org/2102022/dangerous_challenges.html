    <h1>Dangerous TikTok Challenges</h1>
    <p1>As you all know, TikTok has a lot of dangerous challenges. They 
all suck too as a result. Some examples are the the benadryl challenge 
and the devious licks done in 2021. They are all just so stupid. Why 
would anyone enjoy this? It doesn't seem fun. But hey, I guess people 
found enjoyment in that. Just amazing and it's a 10/10 experience (this 
is sarcasm of course).</p1>
    <br>
    <p2>Below, there are resources such as videos about why these 
challenges are dangerous and bad. Some are more complicated than others.
 The benadryl challenge doesn't need much explaining as its even kinda 
bad in the name. Something like Devious Lick, might need more info for 
people who haven't heard of it.</p2>
