<p>This is a fun site I think. Enjoy the site! Contact me if you need some help with something.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:200%;color:red;font-family:sans-serif">Login/Signup will be implemented eventually.</h2>
<h3 style="font-size:150%;color:blue;font-family:comic-sans">I am still making the site so there isn't really anything right now. I will be putting all the webpages on the Wayback Machine so if at some point you want to view this in the future you can.</h3>
