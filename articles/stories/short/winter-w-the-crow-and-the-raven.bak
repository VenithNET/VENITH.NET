                The crow perched on the slowly dying tree. It was near to winter, and the crow was late to sit on such uncomfortable bark. The crow was hungry, but its legs were too lazy.<br>
                The raven, flying away from the harsh winds of the snowstorms, hid in the same tree. Not for perching, but for hiding. The crow had been starving to eat a berry, for the lot of them were frozen. Its chilled feet were too sleepy to continue flying away. The crow cawed, desperate for food.<br>
                The raven had heard the crow's cries for help, and it had flew over, chirping to ask it what was wrong.<br>
                "Oh you must help," The crow had cawed desperately. "I was in search of berries, but my legs are frozen."<br>
                The raven heard well of the crow's request, though it wanted to ask it more. "How long had you perched here for?" It inquired, quizzing the already shivering crow. "Time had passed me by, though I believe a few minutes or more."<br>
                The raven had nodded, yet it had questioned with another.<br>
                "What kind of berries do you so desire?" The crow was growing impatient with each question, but had tried not to lose its temper. It had weakly pointed its wing to the shrub that had been near the tree. The raven laughed elegantly.<br>
                "Crow, crow!" It pat the crow's back. "You can use your beak to get those!" The raven had demonstrated by perching itself near the crow, pecking a berry out and wolfing it down with one bite.<br>
                The crow was a bit wary of the storm, so it had hesitated to do so. A flake of snow had planted itself on the crow's head, and it cawed with discomfort.<br>
                "The snow is too harsh," said the crow. The raven had chortled in response. "I had been scared of the storm too, my friend." The raven had admitted, before proudly getting another, this time popping it into the crow's mouth. "Though it hadn't stopped me for getting what I desire. Neither should it have stopped you."<br>
                The crow had ate the berry, before realizing that the raven had had its mouth on it. It cooed with slight embarrassment, the raven chuckling again. The raven had found the crow's bashfulness a bit hilarious and adoring.<br>
                The crow had calmed itself down, pecking a berry out of the shrub, amd eating it. The crow felt more at ease with itself.<br>
                "Ah," The crow had said. "You did not have to feed me."<br>
                "I did though, my friend." The raven cawed back. "Because I felt that you were also hesitant with the berry's taste." The raven had made an excuse to why it had popped the berry into the crow.<br>
                The crow had felt warmer, although the weather had not changed.<br>
                The crow pecked out a berry,<br>
                and popped it into the raven's beak.
