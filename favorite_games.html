                My all-time favorite game. I've spent countless hours playing
                this game on PSP as a kid, the village you live in, the sounds,
                the music, and the ambience really made me feel like I was home
                when i played it.

                This and LBP1 are my favorite games on the PlayStation 3. It
                made me utilize my imagination and create my own levels and
                machines. The community on this game was amazing and the
                user-created levels were legendary, like
                <a href="https://youtu.be/m2_9EAmsDQQ">"My Little Dead Space"</a
                >, Shark Survival, Bomb survival etc. I played this game
                everyday after school. I miss it dearly, now that the servers
                are closed.

                I've been a fan of the Smash series since I was a kid, I only
                played it on special occasions when my brother brought his
                friends home, so naturally it was the first game I bought on the
                Switch. I never had the opportunity to play the Smash games
                online before, so that was awesome. It made me be able to relive
                these old days but with other people. It's the best and most
                complete Smash Bros game ever. Kirby main BTW.

                It's my first Smash Bros game, and thus it deserves to be on
                this list. It was an awesome game for the GameCube and still is.
                I have a lot of memories playing this game with my brother and
                his friends.

                My brother introduced me to Monster Hunter with Freedom Unite,
                but when this game released on console, we both got it on our
                Wii's. I had a lot of fun playing with my brother and randoms on
                the multiplayer. There was nothing really like it back then, and
                it was very popular. You could fight monsters on the surface or
                underwater, my favorite being the Lagiacrus.

                A hidden gem I discovered recently. You go on mining missions in
                procedurally generated caves, either in solo with Bosco, the
                helper robot, or 3 other teammates heavily inspired by Team
                Fortress classes: Gunner, Engineer, Scout. Oh, and there's the
                driller too. The missions are dangerous, you have to fight a lot
                of bugs. What I love the most about this game is the salute you
                can do to teammates by pressing V: "Rock and Stone!" or, "If you
                don't Rock and Stone, you ain't going home". Also, pinging
                random stuff with the laser pointer makes funny voice lines like
                "Mushroom" or "We're rich" and it's a meme to spam ping these in
                the community. For modern games, it's the best community I know
                of, and the devs are not greedy and are down to earth. There are
                no dumb microtransactions and the only DLC's are cosmetic to
                support the devs.

                Man, I've spent so much time on this game back in the days. You
                could customize your cars and make your own circuits. It had an
                awesome and creative community much like Little Big Planet.
                There were so many custom skins and cars made by the players, it
                was awesome.

                This was my favorite game back on PS2, that game and its PSP
                versions Rogue Squadron and Elite Squadron are masterpieces.
                Nowadays on PC you can even add mods that bring back the
                Battlefront 3 sequel that was supposed to come out. I remember
                finding the secrets and exploring the maps, or just pretending
                to be an AI clone, lol. Back then, I had no concept of online
                multiplayer, and the large scale battles with AI were really
                cool to me.

                The best Mario Kart ever. It was wild playing Mario Kart online
                for the first time when it released. The Wii era was really
                something to live. Everyone knew that game. I remember playing
                this game with my cousins with the plastic wheel where you
                attached your remote in.

                My first Mario Kart game, I also played this with my brother on
                special occasions, an amazing game and I remember how good it
                looked for the time. Not gonna lie, I found the GameCube
                graphics better than the PS2. It has some of the best tracks
                from the series, my favorites being Peach Beach and DK Mountain.
                Also, the Baby Park theme can't get out of my head, send help.

                Gotta be my favorite GameBoy game. Instead of capturing PokÃ©mon,
                you play as one of them, and your mission is to rescue other
                PokÃ©mon with your team. It's probably inspired from that one
                episode where the PokÃ©mon talk to each other to try and find
                their lost masters.

                racing at the time. I was considering becoming a racer back then

                One of the most impressive racing games from the PS3 era. This
                was a blast to play online, there were people driving trucks,
                bikes, monster trucks, all at the same time, and trying to stop
                each others from finishing the race. I miss this series, it was

                This game for me was Battlefront 2 on the go, it even allowed
                you to switch between ground and space battle in the same game.
                It uses a lot of Battlefront III assets and is as close as we
                can get to the cancelled sequel.

                This was a game I played very early in my childhood. I wanted to

                nostalgic, wondrous feeling that I can't explain when I played

                iconic. There were plenty of minigames from all subjects, Star
                Wars, Zombies, etc. You could own your own home, a bit like the
                Sims, and talk to other people. Nostalgic game.

                I replayed this game many many times on PS3, and then on PC,
                where I also played the prequels. I absolutely love the story of
                this game and the soundtrack, it's just perfect. I used to draw
                the "Reapers" a lot when I was a kid, I won't spoil but they are
                an almost immortal race of machines. Please play this series if
                you have not!

                A remaster of the Wii game that I never played. I really love
                this game. One of the best Kirby games I own. It has a lot of
                mini-games and level variety and the gameplay is simple and
                straightforward.

                My second game on the Switch and the one that introduced me to
                Kirby games. Really enjoyed it and it looks amazing. Gameplay is
                fun and challenging at times, and it does everything you expect.
                Level design is superb as well. Soundtrack is also really great.

                The two games, for the prequels and the original trilogy, are my
                favorite Lego games, The movies are well represented and the
                gameplay is fun and intuitive. I spent a lot of my childhood on
                that game as I was also a Star Wars fan (Episode III released
                when I was 5).

                Spent hundreds of hours probably on this game, it is so
                nostalgic and it was fantastic, it even had R.O.B as a
                character. Waluigi Pinball was an awesome map on this.

                Monster Hunter game on the Switch, it brings back the old
                villages from the previous games, and has a nostalgic feel to
                it. Also the biggest monster roster in all the MH Games.

                One of the first games I got on my PC around 2011, I've played
                it ever since, with long breaks sometimes, but I always come
                back to it after a while. You probably already know everything
                about this game. The first version I played was 1.0. I remember
                building huge castles in creative mode, being scared of
                Herobrine, playing with my friends on servers, hosting locally
                with Hamachi, and all the music and other videos that i used to
                watch and still do. Thank you, Notch, for this amazing game and
                the memories associated with it.

                My most played game on Steam, with 3000+ hours on the counter. I
                played mostly its DLC Napoleonic Wars and used to be part of a
                "Regiment" that took part in organized battles with 200 players
                in one server. The game is in my opinion better than its sequel
                Bannerlord. It still has a loyal player base.

                it and made good friends. The story is amazing, but my favorite
                thing was "Arcade" where you could play user-created maps.

                you play on a peaceful map). Still love it today, a unique game
                and the graphics didn't age so badly.
