<h1>CringeToks</h1>
<p1>TikTok contains a whole lot of cringe. I gave it a totally original 
name of CringeTok. Very cool I know. Basically, lots of the content is 
stuff like dances or unfunny humor. It's annoying in my opinion. I have 
this here to document the types of cringe.</p1>
<br>
<p2>Now you may say how there is cringe on all sites. This is true. The 
thing is though, somehow TikTok manages to be the only one with this 
issue to such an extent other than reuploads on YouTube shorts which is 
basically TikTok as well. Horrible dances is mainly it along with 
unfunny humor.</p2>

<p2 style="color:red">Below is a video made by Nesquick about people 
dancing right next to people like their relatives who are dying. Thanks 
N3squick for letting me put the video here.</p2>

<p2 style="text-align:center">Now, there is also dancing for just no 
reason which isn't as bad, but they are still unoriginal. Here is a 
video I made on that subject below.</p2>
