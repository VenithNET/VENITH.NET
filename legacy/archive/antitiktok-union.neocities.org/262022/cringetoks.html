<h1 style="color:gold;font-family:cursive;font-style:italic">CringeToks</h1>
<p1 style="color:lime;font-family:cursive">TikTok contains a whole lot 
of cringe. I gave it a totally original name of CringeTok. Very cool I 
know. Basically, lots of the content is stuff like dances or unfunny 
humor. It's annoying in my opinion. I have this here to document the 
types of cringe.</p1>
<br>
<p2 style="color:cyan">Now you may say how there is cringe on all sites.
 This is true. The thing is though, somehow TikTok manages to be the 
only one with this issue to such an extent other than reuploads on 
YouTube shorts which is basically TikTok as well. Horrible dances is 
mainly it along with unfunny humor.</p2>
