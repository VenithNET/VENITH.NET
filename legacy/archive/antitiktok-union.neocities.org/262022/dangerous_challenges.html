    <h1 style="color:red;background-color:black;text-align:center">Dangerous TikTok Challenges</h1>
    <p1 style="color:red;background-color:black;text-align:center">As 
you all know, TikTok has a lot of dangerous challenges. They all suck 
too as a result. Some examples are the the benadryl challenge and the 
devious licks done in 2021. They are all just so stupid. Why would 
anyone enjoy this? It doesn't seem fun. But hey, I guess people found 
enjoyment in that. Just amazing and it's a 10/10 experience (this is 
sarcasm of course).</p1>
    <p2 style="color:red;background-color:black;text-align:center">Below,
 there are resources such as videos about why these challenges are 
dangerous and bad. Some are more complicated than others. The benadryl 
challenge doesn't need much explaining as its even kinda bad in the 
name. Something like Devious Lick, might need more info for people who 
haven't heard of it.</p2>
