<h1>A Short Explanation of TikTok's Content</h1>
<p>TikTok's content is overall very, very bad. I'm not sure how people 
even watch this bullshit. Can't tell if they are just retarded or what, 
but for some reason the worst things get popular. Everyone basically 
knows of the basics like all those dances by idiotic 14 year olds, but 
there is way more than this. Trends like nyquil chicken where you put 
that stuff that is actual medicine, and you would supposedly eat it 
(started by a satirical video, but people on TikTok aren't smart enough 
to detect that). Also, the benadryl challenge where you take tons of 
benadryl which is easily able to kill you. Overall, I wouldn't recommend
 you watch this stuff and definitely don't recommend you make it. If you
 would like longer explanations with way, way more detail, please check 
out the pages.</p>
