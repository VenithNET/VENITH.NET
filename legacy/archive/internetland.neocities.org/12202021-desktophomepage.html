    <h3 style=font-size:150%;color:blue;font-family:comic-sans>I am still making the site so there isn't really anything right now. I will be putting all the webpages on the Wayback Machine so if at some point you want to view this in the future you can. </h3>

    <h4 style=font-size:125%;color:crimson;font-family:sans-serif>Ok, while you are waiting for the site to be built, go play Minecraft. That or go to any website on dial-up internet because it takes so long half the time that this site will have a chance of going from something you made in middle school to bigger than multiple social media giants combined. Well not really but it sure feels like that.</h4>
    
    <h4 style=font-size:125%;color:purple;font-family:inherit>I do have a YouTube channel for the website right now so yay. Also thank god for Neocities as otherwise I doubt I could easily run the site.</h4>
