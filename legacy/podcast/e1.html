                If the audio quality is messed up, sorry lol I had to record when there was tons of background noise and even as I upload there still is way more that isn't just dead silence that could be edited out in Audacity. I might just have skill issue, whatever though. This episode is about interviewing Mellay who was recently banned from YouTube. Just because a person is featured here does not mean I endorse them though I think thats pretty obvious to anyone with 5 braincells.<br>
